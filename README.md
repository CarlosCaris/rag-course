## Introduction

This repository contains the materials and code needed to build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. A RAG system combines the strengths of large language models with an external knowledge base to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated responses. Throughout this course, you'll gain hands-on experience with the various components of a RAG system, from document chunking to deployment in the cloud.

## Course Outline

- **Objective:** Understand the fundamentals of RAG and its applications.
- **Topics:**
  - Overview of RAG systems
  - Challenges in large language models (e.g., hallucinations, outdated information)
  - Basic components of a RAG system
- **Practical Task:** Set up your development environment and familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
- **Resources:** 
  - Basics
  - More concepts

### Lesson 2: Document Chunking Strategies
- **Objective:** Learn how to effectively segment documents for better retrieval performance.
- **Topics:**
  - Chunking techniques: token-level, sentence-level, semantic-level
  - Balancing context preservation with retrieval precision
  - Small2Big and sliding window techniques
- **Practical Task:** Implement chunking strategies on a sample dataset.
- **Resources:**
  - The five levels of chunking
  - A guide to chunking

### Lesson 3: Embedding Models for Retrieval
- **Objective:** Understand the role of embeddings in representing document chunks for retrieval.
- **Topics:**
  - Overview of embedding models: LLM-Embedder, BAAI/bge, etc.
  - Selecting the right embedding model
  - Integrating embeddings into the retrieval pipeline
- **Practical Task:** Implement and test embedding models on the chunked documents.
- **Resources:**
  - Choosing and embedding model
  - How to select an embedding model

### Lesson 4: Retrieval Methods and Vector Databases
- **Objective:** Build a retrieval system that efficiently searches for relevant document chunks.
- **Topics:**
  - Sparse vs. dense retrieval methods
  - Hybrid search methods (e.g., combining BM25 with dense retrieval)
  - Overview of vector databases: Milvus, Faiss, Qdrant
- **Practical Task:** Set up a vector database and implement a retrieval method.
- **Resources:**
  - What is a vector database
  - Choosing a vector database

### Lesson 5: Reranking Retrieved Documents
- **Objective:** Enhance the relevance of retrieved documents to improve the quality of generated responses.
- **Topics:**
  - Reranking techniques: monoT5, monoBERT, RankLLaMA, TILDEv2, Cohere ReRanker
  - Trade-offs between speed and accuracy
- **Practical Task:** Implement a reranking model and evaluate its impact on retrieval performance.
- **Resources:**
  - Cohere reranker
  - Open-source alternative

### Lesson 6: Document Repacking for Generation
- **Objective:** Optimize the order and structure of retrieved documents before passing them to the generation model.
- **Topics:**
  - Repacking methods: forward, reverse, sides
  - Impact of document order on response generation
  - Integrating repacking into the RAG pipeline
- **Practical Task:** Implement a repacking strategy and integrate it with the retrieval and reranking steps.
- **Resources:**
  - RAG best practices

### Lesson 7: Summarization Techniques for Efficient Generation
- **Objective:** Summarize retrieved documents to fit within the input limits of the generation model while preserving key information.
- **Topics:**
  - Extractive vs. abstractive summarization methods
  - Techniques: Recomp, LongLLMlingua
  - Balancing detail with brevity
- **Practical Task:** Implement a summarization method and test its impact on the generation process.

### Lesson 8: Evaluation and Optimization of the RAG System
- **Objective:** Assess the performance of the entire RAG system and identify areas for improvement.
- **Topics:**
  - Evaluation metrics: Faithfulness, Context Relevancy, Answer Relevancy, Answer Correctness

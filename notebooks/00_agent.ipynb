Find out the grades of severity, the RICE regimen, and the exercises to restore function and balance. Stirrup brace: This type of brace has air cells in a plastic frame that run along either side of your ankle, with a \"stirrup\" under your heel. This brace provides a high level of support—it allows you to walk, but keeps your ankle from rolling. Lace-up ankle braces: These ankle braces slide over your foot and ankle and are \"cinched\" with laces, like a shoe. To treat a sprain, try the R.I.C.E. approach — rest, ice, compression, elevation: Rest the injured area. Your healthcare professional may say not to put weight on the injured area for 48 to 72 hours. You may need to use crutches or not use the sprained area. A splint or brace also may be helpful at first. Learn how to manage a sprained ankle at home with the RICE method, pain relievers, exercises, and more. Find out when to seek medical attention and how to prevent sprains with strengthening exercises, footwear, and warm-ups.'"
